# Algorithms and Data Structures for Beginners
## Arrays ()
### RAM
Ram is measured in bytes. Byte is 8 bits. A bit is the position that can store a digit, the restriction is that it can be a zero or a one. 
RAM stores the values, but every value is stored at a distint location called an address. Arrays are going to be contiguous, meaning that the values stored in RAM are going to be next to eachother. THe address will increment by 4 because intergers are 4 bytes. However, if we store ASCII values, they will increment by 1, because it is 1 byte.
Increment the address by the size of the value.

### Static Arrays
Static arrays are fixed size arrays. Python doesnt offer static, it has dynamic arrays as default. 
Inserting at the end is efficient, but adding at the front or the middle, is not efficient at all. We must shift all of the values to the right. If we add a the front, this is a O(n) time complexity because we are shifting all of the elements to the right.

| 	Operation 	| Time Complexity |
|-----------------------|:---------------:|
| r/w i-th element 	| O(1)  	  |
| Insert/Remove end 	| O(1) 		  |
| Insert middle 	| O(n) 		  |	
| Remove middle		| O(n) 		  |

### Dynamic Arrays
Dynamic arrays resize themselves when more space is requested, for example if we wish to add to the end middle or beginning of the array, but we do not have enough space in the current array.

## Linked Lists
### Singly Linked Lists
A linked list is made up of a chain of nodes. These nodes contain a value and pointer to the next node. A chain of nodes is called a singly linked list becaue every next pointer points to the address of the next node. 

| 	Operation 	| Time Complexity |
|-----------------------|:---------------:|
| r/w i-th element 	| O(n)  	  |
| Insert/Remove end	| O(1)  	  |
| Insert/Remove middle	| O(n)/O(1) 	  |

### Doubly Linked Lists
Exact same as singly linked lists but, now a node also stores a refrence to the previous node aswell as the next node. 

| 	Operation 	| Time Complexity |
|-----------------------|:---------------:|
| r/w i-th element 	| O(n)  	  |
| Insert/Remove end	| O(1)  	  |

### Queues
Queues are similar to stacks. FIFO - first in, first out data structure. Supports two operations, enqueue and dequeue. Elements are added from the end and removed from the front.

| 	Operation 	| Time Complexity |

## Recursion
### Factorial
A factorial, would be a good introduction to recursion. This is called a one-branch recursion. To notice a recursion problem, we have to find if there are sub-problems. The equation for a factorial is as follows: `n! = n * (n - 1)!`. </br>
There is no benefit to using recursion for a factorial problem. However it gives you a good visualization of how recursion works. Here is the code solution for a factorial and the decision tree:
```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: n = 0 or 1
    if n <= 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n - 1)!
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
    
5!	
  \		24	->	120	
   4!		|-
     \		6
      3!	|-
        \	2
	 2!	|-
	   \	1
	    1!
```

Recursion is not recommended because we are using O(n) memory, and we can do this in constant memory using a while loop like so:
```python
int res = 1

while n < 1:
    res = res * n
    n -= 1
	
return res
```

### Fibonacci
This is an example of two-branch recursion. Here is the implementation:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Base case: n = 0 or 1
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    # Recursive case: fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 1)
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Python Basics
## Variables
### Dynamically Typed 
Python variables are dynamically typed. This means that the interpreter assigns variables a type at **runtime** based on the variable's value at the time.
`None` is equivalent to `null`, there is no value when a variable is set to `None`.
```python
n = 0
print('n =', n)
>>> n = 0

n = "abc"
print('n =', n)
>>> n = abc

n = 4
n = None
print("n =", n)
>>> n = None
```

### Multiple Assignments
Use this shorthand notation to assign multiple variables, it makes the look code cleaner.
```python
n, m = 0, "abc"
n, m, z = 0.125, "abc", False
```

### Incrementing 
There is no `++` incrementing in Python!
```python
n = n + 1 # good
n += 1    # good
n++       # bad
```

If you wish to know more about Pythons built-in types, visit the documentation page [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#)

## Math
### Division
Division is python is decimal by default. Notice that we can use a double slash to round down. Division with negative numbers will result in rounding down, whereas in most languages it will be rounded closer to zero. If you want to round closer to zero, use decimal division and then convert the value 
to an integer
```python
print(5 / 2)
>>> 2.5

print(5 // 2)
>>> 2

# Careful here with negative division
print(-3 // 2)
>>> -2

# Workaround to round closer to zero
print(int(-3 / 2))
>>> -1
```

### Modulo
Modding is similar to most languages, expect when we are modding negative values. To be consistent with other languages modulo, use a module. 
```python
print(10 % 3)
>>> 1

print(-10 % 3)
>>> 2

# To be consistent with other languages modulo
import math
from multiprocessing import heap
print(math.fmod(-10, 3))
>>> -1
```

### More Math 
#### Useful Functions
```python
print(math.floor(3 / 2))
>>> 1

print(math.ceil(3 / 2))
>>> 2

print(math.sqrt(2))
>>> 1.4142135623730951

print(math.pow(2, 3))
>>> 8
```

#### +/- Infinity
First two functions create max/min integers. Python numbers are infinite, so they never overflow. However, they will always be less that infinity!
```python
float("inf")
float("-inf")

print(math.pow(2, 200))
>>> 1.6069380442589903e+60

print(math.pow(2, 200) < float("inf"))
>>> True
```

## If Statements
If-statements do not need parentheses or curly braces.
```python
n = 1
if n > 2:
    n -= 1
elif n == 2:
    n *= 2
else:
    n += 2
```
Parentheses are only needed for multi-line conditions.
```python
n, m = 1, 2
if ((n > 2 and 
    n != m) or n == m):
    n += 1
```

## Loops
Remember that loops are inclusive, if you `range(5)` it will print from 0 to 5. 
### While Loops
```python
n = 0
while n < 5:
    print(n)
    n += 1
>>> 0 1 2 3 4
```

### For Loop
#### Looping from `i = 0` to `i = 4`
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
>>> 0 1 2 3 4
```
#### Looping from `i = 2` to `i = 5`
```python
for i in range(2, 6):
    print(i)
>>> 2 3 4 5
```
#### Looping from `i = 5` to `i = 2` 
```python
for i in range(5, 1, -1):
    print(i)
>>> 5 4 3 2
```

# Elements of Programming Interviews in Python
## Arrays

Array problems often have simple brute force solutions that use O(n) space, but there are subtler solutions that use the array itself to reduce space complexity to O(1).
Filling an array from the front is slow, so see if it's possible to write values from the back.
Instead of deleting an entry (which requires moving all entries to its left), consider overwriting it.
When dealing with integers encoded by an array consider processing the digits from the backof the array. Alternately, reverse the array so the least-significant digit is the first entry.
Be comfortable with writing code that operates on subarrays
It's incredibly easy to make off-by-l errors when operating on arrays-reading past the last element of an array is a comrnon error which has catastrophic consequences.
Don't worry about preserving the integrity of the array (sortedness, keeping equal entries together, etc.) until it is time to return.
An array can serve as a good data structure when you know the distribution of the elements inadvance. For example, a Boolean array of length W is a good choice for representing a subset of {0, 1, ..., W - 1}. (When using a Boolean array to represent a subset of {1,2,3, ...,n|, allocate an array of size n+1 to simplify indexing).
When operating on 2D arrays, use parallel logic for rows and for columns.
Sometimes it's easier to simulate the specification, than to analytically solve for the result. For example, rather than writing a formula for the i-th entry in the spiral order for an n x n matrix, just compute the output from the beginning.

### Arrays Syntax
#### Instantiation
```python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(list)
>>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize a list of size n with default value of 1
n = 5
list = [1] * n

print(list)
>>> [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

print(len(list))
>>> 5

list = [i for i in range(5)]

print(list)
>>> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Indexing
```python
list[0] = 0
list[3] = 0
print(list)
>>> [0, 2, 3, 0, 5]

# Careful: -1 is not out of bounds, it's the last value
list = [1, 2, 3]

print(list[-1])
>>> 3

print(arr[-2])
>>> 2
```

#### Slicing
If we have `A = [1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 77]`, these are the following slicing operations we can perform. <br/>
* `A[2:4]` is [3, 4]
* `A[2:]` is [3, 4, 5, 2, 77] 
* `A[:4]` is [1, 6, 3, 4] 
* `A[:-1]` is [1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2] 
* `A[-3:]` is [5, 2, 7] 
* `A[-3:-1]` is [5, 2] 
* `A[1:5:2]` is [6, 4] 
* `A[5:1:-2]` is [2, 4]
* `A[::-1]` is [7, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 1] (reverses list) 

Slicing can also be used to rotate a list `A[k:l] + A[:k]` rotates A by k to the left. It can also be used to create a copy: `B = A[:]` does a (shallow) copy of A into B.
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(arr[1:3])
>>> [2, 3]

# Similar to for-loop ranges, last index is non-inclusive, but no out of bounds error
print(arr[0:4])
>>> [1, 2, 3, 4]

print(arr[0:10])
>>> [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Basic Operations
```python
len(list)
list.append(42)
list.remove(42)
list.insert(3, 28)
list.reverse()
list.sort()
list.sort(reverse=True)

list = ["bob", "alice", "jane", "doe"]
list.sort()

print(list)
>>> ["alice", "bob", "doe", "jane"]

# Custom sort (by length of string)
list.sort(key=lambda x: len(x))

print(list)
>>> ["bob", "doe", "jane", "alice"]
```

#### Looping Through Array
```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]

# Using index
for i in range(len(nums)):
    print(nums[i])
>>> 1 2 3

# Without index
for n in nums:
    print(n)
>>> 1 2 3

# With index and value
for i, n in enumerate(nums):
    print(i, n)
>>> 0 1
>>> 1 2
>>> 2 3

# Loop through multiple arrays simultaneously with unpacking
nums1 = [1, 3, 5]
nums2 = [2, 4, 6]
for n1, n2 in zip(nums1, nums2):
    print(n1, n2)
>>> 1 2
>>> 3 4
>>> 5 6
```

#### 2-D Lists
```python
list = [[0] * 4 for i in range(4)]

print(list)
print(arr[0][0], arr[3][3])
>>> [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

# This won't work as you expect it to
arr = [[0] * 4] * 4
```

#### Value Exists
```python
a in list
```

#### Copying (Shallow & Deep)
```python
listB = listA
```
This will make listB point to listA. They will have the same values.

##### Shallow Copy
A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements. <br/>
So, a shallow copy doesn't create a copy of nested objects, instead it just copies the reference of nested objects. This means, a copy process does not recurse or create copies of nested objects itself.
```python
import copy

old_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
new_list = copy.copy(old_list)

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)
```
Changes in the old_list, will appear in the new_list. Changes in the new_list will not appear in the old_list.

##### Deep Copy
A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of nested objects present in the original elements.
```python
import copy

old_list = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)
```
In the above program, we use deepcopy() function to create copy which looks similar. However, if you make changes to any nested objects in original object old_list, you‚Äôll see no changes to the copy new_list.

#### Key Methods
* `min(A)`, 
* `max(A)`, 
* binary search for sorted lists (`bisect.bisect(A,6)`, `bisect.bisect-left(A,6)`, and `bisect.bisect_right(A,6)`), 
* `A.reverse()` (in-place)
* `reversed(A)` (returns an iterator), 
* `A.sort()` (in-place), 
* `sorted(A)` (returns a copy), 
* `del A[i]` (deletes the i-th element), `and 
* del A[i: j]` (removes the slice)

#### List Comprehension
Python provides a feature called list comprehension that is a succinct way to create lists. A list comprehension consists of:
1. an input sequence 
2. an iterator over the input sequence
3. a logical condition over the iterator (this is optional)
4. an expression that yields the elements of the derived list. 

`[x**2 for x in range(6)]` yields `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` <br/>
`[x**2 for x in range(6) if x%2 == 0]` yields `[0, 4, 16]` <br/>

List comprehension supports multiple levels of looping. This can be used to create the product of sets, e.g., if `A = [1, 3, 5]` and `B = ['d', 'b']`, then `[(x, y) for x in A for y in B]` creates `[(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (5, 'a'), (5, 'b')]`. <br/>

It can also be used to convert a 2D list to a 1D list, e.g., if `M = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e','f']]`, `x for row in M for x in row` creates `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f ']`. <br/>

Two levels of looping also allow for iterating over each entry in a 2D list, e.g., lf A = [[1, 2, 3] , [4, 5, 6]] then `[[x**2 for x in row] for row in M]` yields [[1, 4, 9], [16, 25, 36]]. <br/>

As a general rule, it is best to avoid more than two nested comprehensions, and use conventional nested for loops-the indentation makes it easier to read the program.

## Linked Lists
### Linked Lists Implementations
In a **Singly Linked List** implementation, each node only points to one other node ahead of it. Below is the implementation of a linked list:
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

# Implementation for Singly Linked List
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the list with a 'dummy' node which makes removing a node from the beginning of list easier.
        self.head = ListNode(-1)
        self.tail = self.head
    
    def insertEnd(self, val):
        self.tail.next = ListNode(val)
        self.tail = self.tail.next

    def remove(self, index):
        i = 0
        curr = self.head
        while i < index and curr:
            i += 1
            curr = curr.next
        
        # Remove the node ahead of curr
        if curr and curr.next:
            if curr.next == self.tail:
                self.tail = curr
            curr.next = curr.next.next

    def print(self):
        curr = self.head.next
        while curr:
            print(curr.val, " -> ", end="")
            curr = curr.next
        print()
```

In a **Doubly Linked List** implementation, each node points to the next node and the previous node. Below is the implementation of a duobly linked list:
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

# Implementation for Doubly Linked List
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        # Init the list with 'dummy' head and tail nodes which makes 
        # edge cases for insert & remove easier.
        self.head = ListNode(-1)
        self.tail = ListNode(-1)
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head
    
    def insertFront(self, val):
        newNode = ListNode(val)
        newNode.prev = self.head
        newNode.next = self.head.next

        self.head.next.prev = newNode
        self.head.next = newNode

    def insertEnd(self, val):
        newNode = ListNode(val)
        newNode.next = self.tail
        newNode.prev = self.tail.prev

        self.tail.prev.next = newNode
        self.tail.prev = newNode

    # Remove first node after dummy head (assume it exists)
    def removeFront(self):
        self.head.next.next.prev = self.head
        self.head.next = self.head.next.next

    # Remove last node before dummy tail (assume it exists)
    def removeEnd(self):
        self.tail.prev.prev.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.tail.prev.prev

    def print(self):
        curr = self.head.next
        while curr != self.tail:
            print(curr.val, " -> ")
            curr = curr.next
        print()
```

While we have a full queue, we want to for loop in the range of the length of the queue, so that we visit all of the nodes on that level. We pop from the front, add the value to the list and add the left and right child nodes to the queue. After the for loop, if the level array is not empty, we append it to the result array. The while loop restarts, and continues as long as the child nodes get added. Return the result array <br/>Time Complexity: O(n)<br/>Space Complexity: O(n) |

The base case will be when the node is null, you will return [True, 0] because it has a height of zero and it is balanced, therfore True. Then we will check the left and right child nodes, by calling the DFS function again. This will return the tuple. When we have the left and right tuple, we can check that it is balanced. To be balanced left and right must both be True, and the height must be less than or equal to one. We return a tuple [balanced, 1 + max(left, right)]. After creating the function, we call the DFS function on the root and return the boolean at position 0. Simply put we are recursively traversing to the bottom of the tree to its last nodes and then traversing back up, returning the height and the boolean. <br/>Time Complexity: O(n)<br/>Space Complexity: O(n) |

## Primitive Types
Be very comfortable with the bitwise operators, particularly XOR.
Understand how to use masks and create them in an machine independent way,
Know fast ways to clear the lowermost set bit (and by extension, set the lowermost 0, get its
index, etc.)
Understand signedness and its implications to shifting.
Consider using a cache to accelerate operations by using it to brute-force small inputs.
Be aware that commutativity and associativity can be used to perform operations in parallel
and reorder operations.

### Primitive Types Syntax
Bitwise operations:
```python
Operator 	Example 	Meaning
&		a & b		Bitwise AND (equiv to product)
|		a | b		Bitwise OR
^		a ^ b		Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
~		~a		Bitwise NOT (only unary operator)
<<		a << n		Bitwise left shift
>>		a >> n		Bitwise right shift
```
All binary bitwise operators have a corresponding compound operator that performs an augmented assignment:
```
Operator	Example		Equivalent to
&=		a &= b		a = a & b
|=		a |= b		a = a | b
^=		a ^= b		a = a ^ b
<<=		a <<= n		a = a << n
>>=		a >>= n		a = a >> n
```
