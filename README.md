# Elements of Programming Interviews in Python

## Primitive Types
Be very comfortable with the bitwise operators, particularly XOR.
Understand how to use masks and create them in an machine independent way,
Know fast ways to clear the lowermost set bit (and by extension, set the lowermost 0, get its
index, etc.)
Understand signedness and its implications to shifting.
Consider using a cache to accelerate operations by using it to brute-force small inputs.
Be aware that commutativity and associativity can be used to perform operations in parallel
and reorder operations.

### Primitive Types Syntax
Bitwise operations:
```
Operator 	Example 	Meaning
&		a & b		Bitwise AND (equiv to product)
|		a | b		Bitwise OR
^		a ^ b		Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
~		~a		Bitwise NOT (only unary operator)
<<		a << n		Bitwise left shift
>>		a >> n		Bitwise right shift
```
All binary bitwise operators have a corresponding compound operator that performs an augmented assignment:
```
Operator	Example		Equivalent to
&=		a &= b		a = a & b
|=		a |= b		a = a | b
^=		a ^= b		a = a ^ b
<<=		a <<= n		a = a << n
>>=		a >>= n		a = a >> n
```

## Arrays
Array problems often have simple brute.force solutions that use O(n) space, but there are subtler solutions that use the array itself to reduce space complexity to O(1).
Filling an array from the front is slow, so see if it's possible to write values from the back.
Instead of deleting an entry (which requires moving all entries to its left), consider overwriting it.
When dealing with integers encoded by an array consider processing the digits from the backof the array. Alternately, reverse the array so the least-significant digit is the first entry.
Be comfortable with writing code that operates on subarrays
It's incredibly easy to make off-by-l errors when operating on arrays-reading past the last element of an array is a comrnon error which has catastrophic consequences.
Don't worry about preserving the integrity of the array (sortedness, keeping equal entries together, etc.) until it is time to return.
An array can serve as a good data structure when you know the distribution of the elements inadvance. For example, a Boolean array of length W is a good choice for representing a subset of {0, 1, ..., W - 1}. (When using a Boolean array to represent a subset of {1,2,3, ...,n|, allocate an array of size n+1 to simplify indexing).
When operating on 2D arrays, use parallel logic for rows and for columns.
Sometimes it's easier to simulate the specification, than to analytically solve for the result. For example, rather than writing a formula for the i-th entry in the spiral order for an n x n matrix, just compute the output from the beginning.

### Arrays Syntax
#### Instantiation
```
list = [1,2,3,4,5]
list = [1] + [0] * 10
list(range(100))
```
#### Basic Operations
```
len(list)
list.append(42)
list.remove(42)
list.insert(3, 28)
```
#### Value Exists
```
a in list
```
#### Copying (Shallow & Deep)
```
listB = listA
```
This will make listB point to listA. They will have the same values.
##### Shallow Copy
A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements.

So, a shallow copy doesn't create a copy of nested objects, instead it just copies the reference of nested objects. This means, a copy process does not recurse or create copies of nested objects itself.
```
import copy

old_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
new_list = copy.copy(old_list)

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)
```
Changes in the old_list, will appear in the new_list. Changes in the new_list will not appear in the old_list.
##### Deep Copy
A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of nested objects present in the original elements.
```
import copy

old_list = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)
```
In the above program, we use deepcopy() function to create copy which looks similar. However, if you make changes to any nested objects in original object old_list, you‚Äôll see no changes to the copy new_list.
#### Key Methods
Key methods for list include `min(A)`, `max(A)`, binary search for sorted lists (`bisect.bisect(A,6)`, `bisect.bisect-left(A,6)`, and `bisect.bisect_right(A,6)`), `A.reverse()` (in-place), `reversed(A)` (returns an iterator), `A.sort()` (in-place), `sorted(A)` (returns a copy), `del A[i]` (deletes the i-th element), `and del A[i: j]` (removes the slice)
#### Slicing
`A = [1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 77]`. Here are some examples of slicing: `A[2:4]` is [3, 4], `A[2:]` is [3, 4, 5, 2, 77], `A[:4]` is [1, 6, 3, 4], `A[:-1]` is [1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2], `A[-3:]` is [5, 2, 7], `A[-3:-1]` is [5, 2], `A[1:5:2]` is [6, 4], `A[5:1:-2]` is [2, 4], and `A[::-1]` is [7, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 1] (reverses list). Slicing can also be used to rotate a list `A[k:l] + A[:k]` rotates A by k to the left. It can also be used to create a copy: `B = A[:]` does a (shallow) copy of A into B.
#### List Comprehension
Python provides a feature called list comprehension that is a succinct way to create lists. A list comprehension consists of (1.) an input sequence, (2.) an iterator over the input sequence, (3.) a logical condition over the iterator (this is optional), and (4.) an expression that yieldsthe elements of the derived list. For example, `[x**2 for x in range(6)]` yields [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25],and `[x**2 for x in range(6) if x%2 == 0]` yields [0, 4, 16].

List comprehension supports multiple levels of looping. This can be used to create the product of sets, e.g., if A = [1, 3, 5] and B = ['d', 'b'], then `[(x, y) for x in A for y in B]` creates [(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (5, 'a'), (5, 'b')]. It can also be used to convert a 2D list to a lD list, e.g., if M = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e',
'f']], x for row in M for x in row creates ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f ']. Two levels of looping also allow for iterating over each entry in a 2D list, e.g., lf A = [[1, 2, 3] , [4, 5, 6]] then `[[x**2 for x in row] for row in M]` yields [[1, 4, 9], [16, 25, 36]].

As a general rule, it is best to avoid more than two nested comprehensions, and use conventional nested for loops-the indentation makes it easier to read the program.

While we have a full queue, we want to for loop in the range of the length of the queue, so that we visit all of the nodes on that level. We pop from the front, add the value to the list and add the left and right child nodes to the queue. After the for loop, if the level array is not empty, we append it to the result array. The while loop restarts, and continues as long as the child nodes get added. Return the result array <br/>Time Complexity: O(n)<br/>Space Complexity: O(n) |

The base case will be when the node is null, you will return [True, 0] because it has a height of zero and it is balanced, therfore True. Then we will check the left and right child nodes, by calling the DFS function again. This will return the tuple. When we have the left and right tuple, we can check that it is balanced. To be balanced left and right must both be True, and the height must be less than or equal to one. We return a tuple [balanced, 1 + max(left, right)]. After creating the function, we call the DFS function on the root and return the boolean at position 0. Simply put we are recursively traversing to the bottom of the tree to its last nodes and then traversing back up, returning the height and the boolean. <br/>Time Complexity: O(n)<br/>Space Complexity: O(n) |
