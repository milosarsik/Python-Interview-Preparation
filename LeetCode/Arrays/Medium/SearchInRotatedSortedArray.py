"""
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting 
array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated 
at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, 
return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Time complexity: O(nlogn). We are doing a binary search because the array is somewhat sorted
Space complexity: O(1). We are not using an array, we are just storing in single variables
